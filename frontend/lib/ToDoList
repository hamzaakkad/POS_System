1. diagnoste the stock issue when i try to post a new product and fix it (DONE and it was easy )
2. make a better ui for the Dialog(DONE)
3. add the ability to delete products DELETE FROM product WHERE id = 2 // for example (DONE)
4. i have to edit the ui now so it updates the ui whenever i click the checkout button immedently and removes one the quantity from the item in the ui

5. add descriptive error when  i try to delete some element that is now deletable

6. i might add soft delete to my database and backend to be able to use is_active or nt to the listing but that would require me to change nearly eveerything depending on the listing availability imma see later


7. products edits



BOSS LEVEL :
not really
make a page that has list and in that list list all the ordered_item data 
BUT format that data like for example 
product id 1 is a Derby 
dont type product_id 1 
get its name Derby and type the id aswell i want everything should be clear

Done 

disable the select product gesture if the stock == 0 

make the ADD PRODUCT dialog work with provider and add the ability 
to resize or delete the image and choose another one and when the product is
 posted the dialog clears the info and resets using the same provider .watch()

 ALTER TABLE product ADD INDEX idx_pagination (is_archived, id DESC);
for making the index faster in the dB


now imma test -->   and    <-- in the paginatedProducts route like in the pos system imma go and 
assign a button to do that same function but insted of getting the first page aka cursor = null 
imma make it get the the next cursor after the cursor == null and go for it after that imma make the sae thing but going back to the previous page
